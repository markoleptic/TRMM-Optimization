In this file perform a postmortem. What was the work that was
done? How was it divided? How would you distribute the points amongst your teammates
(50/50, 60/40, 33/33/33?). How did your original statement of work line up with what was
done? How did it evolve? How much time (and/or effort) did this take? How was the time
(and/or effort) distributed across the task and team members? What would you do differently
next time? This can be answered as a team or individually. With the point distribution, there
is a small consensus bonus if the team agrees on the point distribution. If the team does agreee
on a distribution then the average of the distributions will be used. Lastly, include the total
number of person-hours spent on this lab.
