In this lab we divided work by what variants each member wanted to attempt. We then worked on the writeup together and plotting each other variants when needed. 

(33/33/33)

How did your original statement of work line up with what was
done? How did it evolve? How much time (and/or effort) did this take? How was the time
(and/or effort) distributed across the task and team members? 

Our original statement of work lined up mostly with what we originally intended. 

If we were able to do the do it differently we would have our schedule of work more planned out in the beginning as some parts took longer than expected. 

Person-hours:
